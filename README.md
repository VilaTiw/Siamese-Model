# Siamese Network for Face Recognition

#### This project implements a Siamese Neural Network for face verification using the Olivetti Faces Dataset. The Siamese Network is a type of neural network that is used to determine the similarity between two input images. It consists of two identical sub-networks that share weights, which are trained to learn how to differentiate between pairs of similar and dissimilar items. In this implementation, the model takes two images as input and determines whether they belong to the same person (similar) or different people (dissimilar). The dataset used is the Olivetti Faces Dataset, which consists of face images from 40 different individuals.

## Architecture
### The Siamese Network architecture used in this project is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and embedding learning. The network consists of several convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers to generate an embedding vector that represents the facial features.
 - Input Layer: The network receives images of size 64x64 pixels as input. Each image is in grayscale (single channel).
 - Convolutional Layers: The model uses a series of convolutional layers with ReLU activation functions to learn spatial hierarchies of features in the face images. Dropout is applied after each convolutional layer to avoid overfitting.
 - Fully Connected Layers: The feature maps from the convolutional layers are flattened and passed through fully connected layers to generate the final embedding.
 - Distance Layer: This layer computes the distance between the two embedding vectors generated by the sub-networks. The network outputs a probability score (using a sigmoid activation) indicating whether the two images are similar or not.
 - Loss Function: The contrastive loss function is used, which encourages the network to minimize the distance between similar pairs and maximize the distance between dissimilar pairs.

 ## ðŸ“Š Dataset
### The Olivetti Faces Dataset is used for training and testing the Siamese Network. The dataset contains 400 grayscale images of faces (10 images for each of 40 individuals). Each image is of size 64x64 pixels.

## ðŸ›  Requirements
### Ensure you have Python and and related libraries
- Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org)
- Dataset can be downloaded from [olivetti](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imrandude/olivetti)
- You can install related libraries using the following command: pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib scikit-learn Opencv

## ðŸš€ How to Run
- Clone or download the project files
- Open a terminal in the project directory
- Run the main file: python train_model.py

### Training
#### During training, the Siamese Network is provided with pairs of images and a label indicating whether the images belong to the same person (label = 1) or different people (label = 0). The network is trained to minimize the contrastive loss function and optimize the weights.

### Testing and Results
#### After training, the model is tested by comparing pairs of images. The model outputs a probability score for each pair, indicating how similar the images are. The performance of the network is evaluated based on its ability to correctly classify pairs as similar or dissimilar.
